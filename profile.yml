description: A profile for creating Grails applications with Angular 5+
instructions: |
    This profile has created a multi-project build where the "server" module contains the Grails application and the "client" module contains the Angular 6 application.

    To start the Grails application:              `./gradlew server:bootRun`
    To start the client application:              `./gradlew client:bootRun`
    To start both client and Grails applications: `./gradlew bootRun --parallel`

    Run the frontend unit tests and Grails unit tests: `./gradlew test`
    Run the frontend e2e and grails integration tests: `./gradlew integrationTest`

    Node.js/npm is not required when using the Gradle tasks above, but is supported if installed.
    E.g., from the `client` directory, start the client application: `npm start`
