description: A profile for creating Grails applications with Angular 2
instructions: |

    This profile has created a multi-project build where the "server" module contains the Grails application and the "client" module contains the Angular 2 application.

    To start the Grails application separately, execute "./gradlew server:bootRun"
    To start the client side application separately, execute "./gradlew client:bootRun"

    To start both the client and server applications simultaneously, execute "./gradlew bootRun --parallel"
