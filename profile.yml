description: A profile for creating Grails applications with Angular 2
instructions: |

    To start the Grails application separately, execute `./gradlew server:bootRun`
    To start the client side application separately, execute `./gradlew client:bootRun`
    To start both the client and server applications simultaneously, execute `./gradlew bootRun --parallel`

    Run the front-end unit tests and grails unit tests simultaneously with `./gradlew test`
    Run the front-end e2e and grails integration tests simultaneously with `./gradlew integrationTest`

    No need to install Node, though we would recommend doing so if you'll be working with the front-end directly often!
