The previous command creates a Gradle multi-project build where the `server`
module contains the Grails application, and the `client` module contains the Angular 2 application.

* To start the Grails application separately, execute `./gradlew server:bootRun`
* To start the client side application separately, execute `./gradlew client:bootRun`
* To start both the client and server applications simultaneously, execute `./gradlew bootRun --parallel`

No need to install Node, though we would recommend doing so if you'll be working with the front-end directly often!

Although the profile creates a multi-project build, it is possible to combine both `client` and `server` projects into a single build. Read the Guide http://guides.grails.org/angular2-combined/guide/index.html[Combining the Angular Profile Projects] to learn how.
