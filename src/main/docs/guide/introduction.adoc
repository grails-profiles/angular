Grails Profiles encapsulate project commands, templates, and plugins. To create an application using the `angular` profile you can use
the next command:

`grails create-app myapp --profile=angular`

The previous command creates a Gradle multi-project build where the `server`
module contains the Grails application, and the `client` module contains the Angular 2 application.

* To start the Grails application separately, execute `./gradlew server:bootRun`
* To start the client side application separately, execute `./gradlew client:bootRun`
* To start both the client and server applications simultaneously, execute `./gradlew bootRun --parallel`

Although the profile creates a multi-project build, it is possible to combine both `client` and `server` projects into a single build. Read the Guide http://guides.grails.org/angular2-combined/guide/index.html[Combining the Angular Profile Projects] to learn how.

Also, you could create a Grails application using the `angular` profile with the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge]

Grails Application Forge is a great way to discover the different provided features in the profile.
